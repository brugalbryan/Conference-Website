                This is the first annual Cloud Computing Conference at Lehman College. The conference series
                will feature keynote talks, special sessions, poster presentation, tutorials, workshops, and
                contributed papers.
                </p>
                
                 <p>
                    The goal of the conference is to be a premier venue for researchers and industry practitioners to
                    share new ideas, research results and development experiences in various fields. This will be one
                    of a kind in the Bronx.

                    Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from applications to storage
                    and processing power. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
                    economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows
                    companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that
                    cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved
                    manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust
                    resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing
                    capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.

                        <p>My name is Bryan Brugal, I'm a sofware developer based in United States, New York. When I'm not coding, I'm usually 
                            trading stocks, watching a film, ice skating, exercising, playing or watching basketball, reading 
                            about all things tech and finance or eating and drinking my weight in coffee and pastries.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>One of my skills is designing programs with python. I have an associate degree in computer science, and 
                            currently I'm a junior student at Lehman College doing a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
                            I have taken several programming courses such as Data structure, mobile programming, artificial 
                            intelligence, ect.</p>
                       
                        <p>I am taking CMP 128 because I believe that having a website is no longer a luxury, it is now a 
                            necessity. A website today is a global means of communication to the needs required by people 
                            who surf the Internet.</p>
            
                        <p>I enjoy working with code, and trying new technologies. This year, I'm looking to further 
                            my knowledge in web development learning Html, Css, Node.js, React, Redux, JQuery, Bootstrap, 
                            JavaScript, and Django. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Iâ€™m interested in new and exciting projects and opportunities so feel free to get in touch!</p>
